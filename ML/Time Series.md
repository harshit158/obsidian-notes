### Applications of Time Series
---
### Time series Types based on 
1. No. of Time dependent Variables
==Univariate== forecasting => Single time-dependent variable
==Multivariate== forecasting => More than one time-dependent variable

2. No. of values to predict in future
	a) ==One-Step== forecasting	
	b) ==Multi-Step== forecasting

### Properties
1. **==Stationarity==**:
	(The properties of one section of data are much like the properties of other sections of data)
		Refer to MOOC content [[MOOCs/Practical Time Series/Week 3#^9cd811]]
	-	Statistical properties of time series DO NOT change over time. 
		Following are the <u>conditions for stationarity</u>:
		-	Mean is constant (There is no Trend)
		-	Variance is constant
		-	There is no Seasonality


	-	Ideally we want to have stationary time series

	- How to <u>check for stationarity</u>:
		- Visually
		- Global vs Local test (eg Mean of small range VS Mean of entire time series range)
		- [[Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test]] (ADF)

	- How to <u>make Data Stationary</u> ^013637
		- Differencing - difference between consecutive observations
		- Linear Regression

3. **==Seasonality==**:
4. **==Autocorrelation==**: 
	- Represents the degree of similarity between a given time series and lagged version of itself over successive time intervals
	- Measures the relationship between a variable's current value and its past values
	- Can't use OLS (linear regression) since autocorrelation violates independence assumption [[Linear Regression#^320904]]

### Components of a Time Series
1. Trend
2. Seasonality
3. Cycle
4. Irregularities / Noise

We generally decompose a given time series into these components and then analyse them separately

ðŸ¥Š  How to identify seasonality / period of a time series ?
- Visually by looking at the plot
- Logically based on the meaning of the variable
- Plug in the different periods and see the result of downstream tasks
