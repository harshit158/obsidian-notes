Hence, the weight update equation is:

From the above formula:
-   If ==w is positive==
	-   the regularization parameter 位 \> 0 will push w to be less positive, by subtracting 位 from w.
-   If ==w is negative==
	-   the regularization parameter 位 < 0 will push w to be less negative, by adding 位 to w. hence this has the effect of pushing w towards 0.
