==Advantages:==
- Simple to implement
- Smooth decision boundary with right K
	- ==High K== -> Smooth decision boundary
	- ==Low K== -> More noisy

- Can fit non-linear decision boundaries


==Disadvantages:==
- Inefficient : Scans entire training data to find K-nearest neighbours to aggregate the value
