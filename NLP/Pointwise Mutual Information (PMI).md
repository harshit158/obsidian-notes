The pointwise mutual information represents **a quantified measure for how much more- or less likely we are to see the two events co-occur, given their individual probabilities**, and relative to the case where the two are completely independent.

In NLP, it is used for:
- Finding the association between a label and a category
- Finding collocations, such as New York
	- New and York and more likely to appear than New and Dog
