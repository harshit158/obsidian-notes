#### Cons
- **Singular deployment**
	- Entire application is deployed as one unit - pose challenges in updates / testing
	- No concept of scaling modules / need to scale the entire app
	- May not be cost effective
	  
- **Limited technology stack**
	- Only single programming language can be used hence no scope of experimentation and innovation
	  
- **Challenges in upgrades**
	- Deploying as a single unit poses risk of system wide failure
