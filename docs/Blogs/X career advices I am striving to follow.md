	- And preferably implement them from scratch
- Sort our your note-taking workflow
	- Because it will be a mess later on
	- You can go through my earlier posts on how

- Whether you want to go into research or not - start reading papers sooner than later
- If you are learning multiple things at once, I would recommend them to be from different medias - textbook, MOOCS
