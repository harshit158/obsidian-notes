```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [1] * len(nums)
        
        for i in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[j] > nums[i]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1+dp[j])
        
        return max(dp)
```
