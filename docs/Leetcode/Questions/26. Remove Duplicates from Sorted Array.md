---
## Approach:
#two-pointers 
Keep track of two pointers:
- One for traversing the array
- One for tracking the index at which next unique element will be placed

- Also keep track of unique element that was seen last and do nothing as long as we keep seeing this element.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # this will be the idx at which next unique element will be placed
        # this will also be used to return the count of unique elements
        unique_count = 0

        # current unique element that has been running
        # can be anything since it will anyways be replaced by the first element
        # in the very first loop
        curr_unique = -1000
        
        for num in nums:
            if num != curr_unique:
                curr_unique = num
                nums[unique_count] = num
                unique_count+=1
                
        return unique_count
```
