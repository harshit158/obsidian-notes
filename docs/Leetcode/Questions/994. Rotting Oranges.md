## Approach:
Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y704fEOx0s0

#BFS 
- ==Multi-source== BFS
- Push all the original rotten oranges into the queue, and start BFS from all of them
- Keep track of fresh oranges in the board initially
- Once BFS is over, check if fresh_oranges\==0

#finding 
- To delimit different layers, put (-1, -1) into the deque
- Use "directions" to iterate over neighboring cells

```python
class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dq = deque()

        fresh_oranges = 0
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    fresh_oranges+=1
                if grid[r][c] == 2:
                    dq.append((r,c))
        
        dq.append((-1, -1)) # to dilineate different layers

        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        time_elapsed = -1
        while dq:
            r, c = dq.popleft()
            if r==-1:
                # level changed, meaning 1 minute has passed
                time_elapsed+=1
                if dq:
                    # first layer of rotten oranges are over
                    # meaning we have processed all of their children
                    dq.append((-1, -1))
            else:
                for dx, dy in directions:
                    nx, ny = r+dx, c+dy
                    if 0<=nx<ROWS and 0<=ny<COLS:
                        if grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                            grid[nx][ny] = 2
                            fresh_oranges-=1
                            # this orange has gone bad
                            # so it can effect others - add it just like
                            # initial ones were added in deque
                            dq.append((nx, ny))
        
        return time_elapsed if fresh_oranges==0 else -1
