## Approach:
#heap #linked-list 
Use heap for finding the node having the smallest value
And then point the next pointer of current node to this smallest node.

#finding 
We can insert tuple in a heap
heapq.heappush(min_heap, ==(value1, value2)==)
But both elements of tuple should be comparable
If there is a tie with first element (value1), it will compare values of second element (value2)
