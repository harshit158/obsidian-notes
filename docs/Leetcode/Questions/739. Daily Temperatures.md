## Approach:
#monotonic-stack #stack 
- Keep a stack containing the indices of temperatures 
- Push in the stack only when current temperature is LESS THAN last added temperature. This means, at any time, the stack will be sorted in descending order
- Once a warmer temperature is encountered, keep popping elements from the stack till a higher temperature than the current one is found.
- Once all the smaller temperatures have been popped out, insert the current temperature

**Time**: O(2*N) since in the worst case, each element will be pushed and popped out just once (total twice)
**Space**: O(N)
