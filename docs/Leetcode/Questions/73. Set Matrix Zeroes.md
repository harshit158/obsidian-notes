## Approach:
Use ==first rows and first cols as flags== to say if the matrix element in that cell is 0 or not

**Step1:** Iterate through matrix to mark zero rows and cols
```python
for row in range(m):
	for col in range(n):
		if matrix[row][col] == 0:
			
			if row == 0:
				first_row_has_zero = True
			if col == 0:
				first_col_has_zero = True
			
			matrix[row][0] = matrix[0][col] = 0
```

==**Edge Case:**==
If FIRST ROW has 0 -> it will make ==matrix(0,0) to 0== as well
And since the flag for all the cells in the FIRST COLUMN is also in (0,0), all the elements in FIRST COLUMN will be 0 as well
Hence, track if first row and col has 0 in them separately

**Step2:** Update all appropriate cells to 0
==Remember to start scanning from (1,R) and (1,C) since we will do a separate pass for FIRST ROW and FIRST COL==
```python
 for row in range(1, m):
	for col in range(1, n):
		matrix[row][col] = 0 if matrix[0][col] == 0 or matrix[row][0] == 0 else matrix[row][col]
```

**Step3:** Update first row and col if they had 0
```python
if first_row_has_zero:
	for col in range(n):
		matrix[0][col] = 0

if first_col_has_zero:
	for row in range(m):
		matrix[row][0] = 0
```
