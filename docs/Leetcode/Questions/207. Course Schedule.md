## Approach:
#topological-sort
Refer [[Topological Sort]]
- Return True if there is a possible topo sort given the prerequisites
- Keep track of total as well as removed nodes 

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]):
        # Making graph (adjaceny list for outgoing edges and in_degree counter) from prerequisites
        adj_list_out, in_deg = defaultdict(list), {}
        num_edges = 0
        for course, prereq in prerequisites:
            num_edges+=1
            adj_list_out[prereq].append(course)
            in_deg[course] = in_deg.get(course,0)+1
        
        # Finding nodes that have no incoming edges and adding to queue
        dq = deque([k for k in range(numCourses) if k not in in_deg])
        
        # Popping from queue, removing edges and adding new nodes with no incoming edges
        removed_edges = 0
        while dq:
            course = dq.popleft()
            for out_node in adj_list_out[course]:
                in_deg[out_node]-=1
                removed_edges+=1
                
                if in_deg[out_node] == 0:
                    dq.append(out_node)
        
        # if there are still some nodes left, then it has some cycles
        if num_edges == removed_edges:
            return True
        else:
            return False
