	- Small (==Max== heap) - stores **lower half** of numbers
	- Large (==Min== heap) - stores **upper half** of numbers
- Add number to small heap and check if:
	- max num in Small is > min num in Large -> Move from small to large
	- if len(Small/Large) , move it to Large/Small
	- ==(order of these steps matter)==
