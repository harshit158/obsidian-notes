## Approach:
#binary-search #hashmap 
- Define the data structure to be 
```python
kv = {key1: [(value1, t1),
			 (value2, t2), ..],
	  key2: [(value1, t1),
	         (value2, t2), ..],
	  ...       }

```
- While retrieving a key, get all its (value, t) pairs and since inserted timestamps are already in ascending order, do ==Binary Search to search for largest timestamp <= given timestamp==
