## Approach:
#BFS 
- Store (node, index) as the elements in the deque, as shown below
- The width at each level is :
	- (index of first node at that level) - (index of last node at that level) + 1

#finding 
If the index of a parent node is C, accordingly we can define the index of its :
- index of its **_left_** child node as ==2⋅C== and the 
- index of its **_right_** child node as ==2⋅Ci+1==

Refer [[BFS#^3cd2de]] for tracking level wise information
