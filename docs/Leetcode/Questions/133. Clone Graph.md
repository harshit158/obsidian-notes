title: 133. Clone Graph

## Approach:
#BFS 
See comments in the code
- Clone while traversing the original graph through BFS
- Similar to BFS, but difference is that the last line is outside the "if" block, which means that we want to add edge between 
- *curr_node* and *neigh* irrespective of whether neigh is already visited or not.
- Notice that we return ==visited[node]==
- ==visited== is a dictionary that stores original node number as the key along with its copy as its value
