#bitwise-and 
- Do bitwise and of given number and 1
  The result will be 1 only if the left most bit of n is 1, else 0
- Once the Anding is done, do bitwise right shift by 1 so that we now move to the next left bit (>>)

**Time**: O(1) since we are talking about just 32 bits max
**Space**: O(1)

## Approach:
#bitwise-and 
- Do n = n&(n-1) while n is not equal to 0
  This will run same number of times as there are 1s in it.
