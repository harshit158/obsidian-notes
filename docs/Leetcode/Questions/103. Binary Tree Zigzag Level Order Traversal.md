Similar to [[102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal]], but here each element of container is not a list, but a deque

This is because we want to add elements to container from ==left->right== and ==right->left== depending on current depth of the node. And to append element in the beginning, DEQUE has O(1) complexity.

**Time**: O(N) since each node is visited EXACTLY ONCE
**Space**: O(N) to store node values in the container
