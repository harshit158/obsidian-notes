- Reframe the problem as : Finding the subset of nums that equals (total_sum)//2
- Each num in nums can either be there in the subset or not
- The idea is to find all the possibilities of sums and seeing if total_sum//2 happens to be present in them
- nums=[1,2,3,4,5]
- Steps:
	- Iteration1 : 1 can be present or not : dp = [1]
	- Iteration2: Add 2 itself + sum it with all previous sums already present in dp: dp = [1,3,2]

```python
class Solution:
    def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        sum_nums = sum(nums)
        if sum_nums%2!=0:
            return False
        
        subset_sum = sum_nums//2

        dp = set()
        dp.add(nums[0])
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            new_dp = dp.copy()
            for t in dp:
                new_dp.add(t+nums[i])
                new_dp.add(nums[i])
            dp=new_dp
        
        return subset_sum in dp
```
