## Approach:
#doubly-linked-list #hashmap 
- make a dictionary: key -> node
- Keep a doubly linked list: 
	- the node that is most recently used right ==after head==
	- the node least used is right ==before tail==

- **get func** ->
	- as and when a key is accessed, ==move it right after head== of the doubly linked list, since it got used recently
	- add the key in cache if not already present and the newly created node as its value
- **put func** ->
	- if key is not already there:
		- create a node and push it ==right after head== (used most recently)
	- if addition leads to overflow:
		- delete ==node right before tail==, since this is the node which is <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">LEAST RECENTLY USED (LRU)</mark>
