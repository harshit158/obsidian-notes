## Approach:
#trees #BFS  ==iterative==

-> Treat the left subtree and right subtree as two separate trees and the problem is now reduced to checking if two trees are mirror of themselves.
-> Push t1.left and t2.right together in the queue. 
-> And while popping out, if these are found to be different. Then they are not mirrored
