## Approach1:
-> Sliding Window
Ref: Refer Leetcode approach 1
#sliding-window #bitwise-and
- Right pointer is used to expand the current window
- Left pointer is used to contract the window

Steps:
- Initialize l and r pointers
- Use r to expand the window until you encounter the desirable window
- At this point, start contracting the window by moving l to right, since we are interested in minimum length answer
- If the window becomes undesirable upon contracting, time to move r and expand again

#finding 
a = Counter('abb')
b = Counter('aab')
a&b -> {'a':1, 'b':1}
