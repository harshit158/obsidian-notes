## Approach:
#union-find 
Conditions to be a ==valid tree==:
1. No cycles
	- If there is no merge in the union step, there is a cycle present
2. Fully connected
	- The value of "count" should be 1 at the end of the loop (OR)
	- Check for "Number of edges == n-1" 

#finding 
1. Tree has n-1 edges  
2. Disjoint Set can detect if there is cycle in graph  
3. Graph with less than n-1 edges is definitely not connected  
4. Graph with more than n-1 edges definitely has cycle
