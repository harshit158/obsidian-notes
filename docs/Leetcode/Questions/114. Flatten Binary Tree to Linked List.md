## Approach:
#trees #recursive 
Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKnD7rLT0lI&t=800s

- Flatten out left and right subtree recursively
- Each recursive execution should return the tail of the flattened tree

```python
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify root in-place instead.
        """
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return None
            
            lefttail = dfs(root.left)
            righttail = dfs(root.right)

            if lefttail:
                lefttail.right = root.right
                root.right = root.left
                root.left = None
            else:
                # this means if has only right subtree
                # don't need to do anything here, since the right subtree
                # is already flattened and connected in proper way
                pass
            
            last = righttail or lefttail or root
            return last
```

## Approach:
#trees #iterative 
- Use BFS to traverse and store nodes at different levels
- Once we get nodes from each level, just traverse iterate over those nodes while linking them appropriately
