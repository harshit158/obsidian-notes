-> Keep a set of give numbers
-> For each num, check if its the start of the "consecutive sequence" by searching for num-1 in the set
-> If its not the start, continue ; otherwise maintain the streak and search for next consecutive numbers

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_set = set(nums)
        ans = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if (nums[i]-1) in nums_set:
                # current num is not the start of the sequence
                continue
            else:
                # a new sequence starts, lets maintain the streak
                streak = 1
                start = nums[i]+1
                # keep increasing streak as long as we can find the 
                # consecutive numbers
                while start in nums_set:
                    streak+=1
                    start+=1
                ans = max(ans, streak)
                
        return ans
```
