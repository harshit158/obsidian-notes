**Time**: 
push O(1)
pop Amortized O(1), worst case O(n)
==Amortized since most of the times, output stack will have something. Only when output stack is empty, we would need to transfer all the elements from input stack to output stack==
peek Amortized O(1), worst case O(n)
empty O(1)
**Space**: O(n)
