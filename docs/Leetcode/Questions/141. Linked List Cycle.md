## Approach1:
Using #two-pointers , also known as ==Tortoise-and-Hare== approach
This is exactly similar to [[876. Middle of the Linked List]] , where one pointer moves at double the speed of another.
If there is a cycle, these pointers will meet at some point. Refer [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/solution/) for the tutorial.  ^ab2f23
```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            
            if slow==fast:
                return True
                
        return False
```

## Approach2:
Using #hashmap 
Simply keep track of nodes in a ==SET== and if we find a node already in the set, it has a cycle in it.  ^dbe582
