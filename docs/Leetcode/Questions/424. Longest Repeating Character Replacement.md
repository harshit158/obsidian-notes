## Approach:
#sliding-window 
Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqXU1UyA8pk

1. Increase the window if the substring is valid
   - The max frequency of any character in the current window is identified
   - All other characters hence need to be converted to this maxfreq character
   - Hence, if (length-of-current-window) - max_freq <=k, it means we have enough ks
     to replace other chars to max_freq character, otherwise:
2. slide the window with the same length. No need to shrink the window

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        counts = {}
        leftp = 0
        maxlen = 0
        maxfreq = 0

        for rightp in range(len(s)):
            counts[s[rightp]] = counts.get(s[rightp], 0) + 1
            maxfreq = max(maxfreq, counts[s[rightp]])

            if (rightp - leftp + 1) - maxfreq <= k:
                maxlen = max(maxlen, (rightp - leftp + 1))
            else:
                counts[s[leftp]] -= 1
                leftp += 1

        return maxlen
```
