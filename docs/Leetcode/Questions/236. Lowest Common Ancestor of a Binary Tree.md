## Approach: Using Parent Pointers
#trees 
Do ==iterative== preorder traversal / ==any traversal (BFS)==, and keep track of parent of each of the nodes before inserting into the stack
```python
if node.left:
	parent[node.left] = node  #<= Focus
	stack.append(node.left)
```

```python
# keeping track of ancestors for p
ancestors = set()

# scanning all the ancestors of p
ancestors.add(p) #since p itself is also considered its own ancestor
while p:
	ancestors.add(parent[p])
	p = parent[p]
```
