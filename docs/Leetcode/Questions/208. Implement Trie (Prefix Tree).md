## Approach:
#trie 
Use nested dictionary structure as the data structure for trie.

3 operations:
1. Insert: time -> O(m), space -> O(m) where m = len(key)
2. Search for a key: time -> O(m), space -> O(1)
Once the entire key is scanned, current node should have =="end"== in the current node.
3. Search for a key prefix: time -> O(m), space -> O(1)
Unlike above, there is no need to search for "end" since we are looking for only a prefix
