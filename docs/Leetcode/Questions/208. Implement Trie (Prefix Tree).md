## Approach:
#trie 
Use nested dictionary structure as the data structure for trie.

3 operations:
1. Insert: time -> O(m), space -> O(m) where m = len(key)
2. Search for a key: time -> O(m), space -> O(1)
Once the entire key is scanned, current node should have =="end"== in the current node.
3. Search for a key prefix: time -> O(m), space -> O(1)
Unlike above, there is no need to search for "end" since we are looking for only a prefix

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        curr = self.root
        for c in word: 
            if c not in curr.children:
                curr.children[c] = TrieNode()
            curr = curr.children[c]
        curr.end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        curr = self.root
        for c in word:
            if c not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[c]
        return curr.end_of_word

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        curr = self.root
        for c in prefix:
            if c not in curr.children:
                return False
            curr = curr.children[c]
        return True


# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
```
