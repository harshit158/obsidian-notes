## Approach1:
#min-heap #heap 

- We can use min heap like usual - at any point in time, the top element should have:
	- least freq
	- ==BUT last as per lexicographical order==
- If we put a tuple of (freq, word), the heapify will put smaller freq words at the top
- Similarly in case of ties, it will keep "earlier" words (alphabetically) at the top, which is ==NOT what we want== . We want the words that come last alphabetically at the top since they will be the ones that will be removed because of "if len(ans) > k"
- Hence, modify the default =="lt" func== of the Node, where Node is the tuple we are adding

```python
class Node():
    def __init__(self, freq, word):
        self.freq = freq
        self.word = word

    def __lt__(self, other):
        # here other refers as in object1 < other
        if self.freq == other.freq:
            return self.word > other.word
        return self.freq < other.freq

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        ans = []
        counts = collections.Counter(words)
        for word, freq in counts.items():
            heapq.heappush(ans, Node(freq, word))
            if len(ans) > k:
                heapq.heappop(ans)
        
        return [x.word for x in sorted(ans, reverse=True)]
```
