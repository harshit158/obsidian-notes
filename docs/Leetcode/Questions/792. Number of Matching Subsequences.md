title: 792. Number of Matching Subsequences

tags: #leetcode #new
difficulty:

---
## Approach:
#hashmap 
Trick is that scan through the Target string only once,
use ==Hashmap== where ```KEY= each character in Target string, 
										VALUE=indices where this character appears in the target string```
Refer [Approach No. 3](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/solution/)

```python
def numMatchingSubseq(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        def is_subsequence(s, word):
            idx_curr = -1
            for char in word:
                if not char2idx[char]:
					# there is no such character in Target, exit early
                    return False
                cand_idx = char2idx[char]
				# Below code can be optimized
                for idx in cand_idx:
                    if idx>idx_curr:
                        idx_curr = idx
                        break
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                return True
            
        # build hashmap on top of Target string
        from collections import defaultdict
        char2idx = defaultdict(list)
        for idx, char in enumerate(s):
            char2idx[char].append(idx)
        
        count = 0
        for word in words:
            count = count+1 if is_subsequence(s, word) else count
        return count
```
==optimization:==
-> while searching for the right candidate idx, use binary search 
-> #finding [bisect.bisect_right()](Python#^9c70f6) function -> This has O(logN) complexity , same as Binary search
