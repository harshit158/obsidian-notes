## Approach:
#BFS 
- Start from a ocean and work backwards -> each cell that can be traversed inward is the cell from which we can reach the ocean
- Do this for both oceans, while tracking the visited cell (each visited cell is also the cell from which the water can flow to the ocean)
- Take the intersection of the visited cells for each ocean and that will be the answer
