## Approach:
#BFS 
Need to track nodes at each level.
But the conventional way will not be memory efficient since need a separate container to store values. 
Need to somehow process the nodes in-place without storing the values in a separate structure

Refer approach [[BFS#^3cd2de]]

**Time**: O(N), each node is processed exactly once (popping + manipulating next pointer) 
**Space**: O(N), space occupied by deque which is proportional to number of nodes at a level. The max nodes in this case will be at the last level (N/2) since its a perfect binary tree.
