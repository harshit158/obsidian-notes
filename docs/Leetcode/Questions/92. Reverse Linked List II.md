## Approach:
```python
	# empty list
	if not head:
		return head

	# move until curr has reached the starting point of the sublist that has to be reversed 
	prev, curr = None, head
	idx = 1
	while idx!=left:
		prev = curr
		curr = curr.next
		idx+=1

	left_boundary_ptr = prev
	left_head = curr
```

```python
# keep reversing the list from here until we identify the right end of the sublist that has to be reversed
        prev, curr = ListNode(-1), left_head
        while (idx-1)!=right:   # focuse on (idx-1)
            next = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next
            idx+=1
        
        right_boundary_ptr = curr #NULL
```

```python
# if left_boundary_ptr is None, that means the sublist starts right from the beginning
        if not left_boundary_ptr:
            head = prev
        else:
            left_boundary_ptr.next = prev
        
        # pointing left head of sublist to right boundary
        left_head.next = right_boundary_ptr
```
