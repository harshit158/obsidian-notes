## Approach:
#deque 
- Keep the deque always ==monotonically decreasing== for each window
- In that case, the maximum number for each window lies at ==dq[0]==, since elements are in decreasing order
- ==push the indices== instead of the numbers
- while appending new element for current window:
	- remove all elements that are smaller than that number and then insert it

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        from collections import deque
        dq = deque()
        output= []
        l = 0 #we do need r also but, we can use i as a substitute for r
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # keep removing elements from dq as long as they are smaller than
            # current element
            while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < nums[i]:
                dq.pop()
            
            dq.append(i)
            
            # we haven't reached the size of the window yet, don't start 
            # removing elements from left yet
            if i<k-1:
                continue
            
            # once current window is processed, dq[0] should give us maximum element
            # for current window
            output.append(nums[dq[0]])
            
            # if the leftmost element in dq (leftmost index in dq) falls outside
            #  of current window, then just discard it. We want elements only for the 
            # current window
            if dq[0]<=l:
                dq.popleft()
            
            # left boundary needs to be incremented to process next window
            # right boundary is maintained by "i"
            l+=1
            
            # At the end of every iteration, dq remains
            # "monotonically decreasing" -> IMPORTANT
        
        return output
