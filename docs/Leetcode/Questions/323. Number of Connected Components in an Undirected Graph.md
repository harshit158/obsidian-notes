## Approach:
#DFS 

```python
class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def dfs(node):
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    dfs(neighbor)

        visited = set()
        count = 0
        adj = collections.defaultdict(list)

        for x, y in edges:
            adj[x].append(y)
            adj[y].append(x)

        for node in range(n):
            if node not in visited:
                count+=1
                visited.add(node)
                dfs(node)
        
        return count
```
