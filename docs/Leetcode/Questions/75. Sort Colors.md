## Approach:
#two-pointers 

- Take 3 pointers:
	- p0 as the right most boundary of 0s - move p0 if 0 is found
	- p2 as the left most boundary of 2s - move p2 towards left if 2 is found
	- curr to process current element

- When should curr be incremented ?:
	- it depends on whether the element that comes at "curr" place can be further relocated
	- If curr is 0, then the element that swaps with curr, is coming from the left and hence must have been already accounted for. So the modified curr doesn't need further processing
	- If curr is 2, the swapping element is coming from right and since we don't know what that number is yet, we won't want to increment curr.

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        p0 = 0 #rightmost boundary of 0s
        p2 = len(nums)-1 #leftmost boundary of 2s
        curr = 0 #
        
        while curr <= p2:
            if nums[curr] == 0:
                nums[p0], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[p0]
                p0+=1
                curr+=1
            
            elif nums[curr] == 1: 
                curr+=1
            
            elif nums[curr] == 2:
                nums[p2], nums[curr] = nums[curr], nums[p2]
                p2-=1
            
```
