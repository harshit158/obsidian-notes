similar: [[278. First Bad Version]]

---
## Approach:
#binary-search 
This is similar to 278. 
There we were finding just the first occurence of bad version
Here, we need to write to separate functions to find both the first and last positions using similar logics
-> Can optimize using the result of the first function we call
