## Approach:
#two-pointers 
Similar to [[26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array]] but we also need to keep track of additional pointer freq to keep track of duplicate numbers we have placed so far (max freq can be 2 in this case)

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        freq = 0
        unique_count = 0
        curr_unique = 'random'
        for num in nums:
            if num != curr_unique:
                curr_unique = num
                nums[unique_count] = num
                unique_count+=1
                freq=1 #since we have placed one occurence of this unique number
            else:
                if freq==1:
                    # if current num is not unique but have been placed exactly once
                    # in the previous iterations
                    nums[unique_count] = num
                    unique_count+=1
                    freq=0
        
        return unique_count
```
