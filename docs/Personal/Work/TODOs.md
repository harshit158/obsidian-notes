- [ ] Distributed Training:
	- [ ] Training: Spark
	- [ ] Serving: Ray
- [ ] Identify the seasonality from the data automatically
	- [ ] Using FFT from Kats (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-detect-seasonality-outliers-and-changepoints-in-your-time-series-5d0901498cff#:~:text=FFTDetector%20%E2%80%94%20Fast%20Fourier%20Transform%20Seasonality%20Detector)
- [ ] Test on Packet Loss
- [ ] While re-training the model, use a context vector from the past time series to feed it along with the next batch


**03 / 03 / 2022**
- [ ] Prophet on original 10s interval data:
	- Predictions not responsive to daily spikes
	- Probably because of noise which can be controlled by:
		- Sampling / Smoothing data (reducing data by some fraction) using Rolling Averages
		- Aggregation at the level of Min / Hours
- [ ] Training prophet on each of:
	- Min / 15 min / 30 min / 1 hour / 1 day / 1 week - This worked
	- Comments for 15 min predictions:
		- Downward trend for farther time stamps
			- ðŸ”¥ Re-training
				- When ?
					- Confidence band / Uncertainty widens
					- Performance metric degrades / Loss Curves
				- On What ? 2 Weeks of data
		- ==Aggregation can mislead== the model if ==re-training== is not done
- [ ] Prophet on multiple streams
	- [ ] Seasonal 1 
	- [ ] Seasonal 2
	- [ ] Irregular 3 - Aggregation matters - ==Too high-level will miss the anomalies==

Possible Research / Novelty:
- [ ] Automatic Appropriate Segmentation
- [ ] Automatic identification of horizon length
- [ ] Why patterns in some whereas none in others ?
- [ ] RCA
