p-value
---
Its always easy to ==disprove== things through an example, than ==prove== things

Hence we define, 
- ==Null hypothesis== -> the statement that we want to ==disprove==
- ==Alternate hypothesis== -> the statement that we want to ==prove==

The idea is that we want to disprove Null hypothesis based on **p-value**
- If p-value > threshold, then NULL hypothesis is True
- Otherwise, alternate hypothesis is True

This means that:
- ==p-value is the probability that the NULL hypothesis is True==
- p value is the probability that observed values occured by chance
