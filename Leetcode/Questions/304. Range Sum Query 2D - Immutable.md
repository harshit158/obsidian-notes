## Approach:
#prefix-sum  Cache Rows
Exactly like [[303. Range Sum Query - Immutable]] but for 2D.
Treat ==each row== like a 1D array and cache its sum.

```python
for i in range(m):
	sum = 0  
	for j in range(n):
		sum = sum + matrix[i][j]
		self.sums[i][j] = sum
```

## Approach:
Cache but with respect to origin as the reference
Edge cases for computing sum:

Instead of handling so many edges pertaining to i=0 and j=0, simply do it for the range(1, num rows+1)
and initialize 0th row and col as 0s
