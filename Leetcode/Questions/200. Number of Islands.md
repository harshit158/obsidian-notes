## Approach:
#BFS
Treat the grid as a graph
Find number of connected components in the graph

1. Initiate the BFS from all those cells that are "1"
2. While doing BFS starting from a single cell, convert all "1" to "0" that are encountered in the BFS tree to avoid duplication. Think of this as sinking the island slowly 
3. Unlike typical BFS implementation, ==use "grid" to track of visited cells inside the BFS function==
