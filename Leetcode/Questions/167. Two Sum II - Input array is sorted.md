tags: #leetcode #new #amazon
difficulty: #easy 

## Approach1:
Use ==two pointers==
Increment front / Decrement rear depending whether nums[front] + nums[rear] >/</= target

**Concepts**: #two-pointers
**Link**: https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/496048202/
**Time**: ==O(n)==
**Space**: O(1)

## Approach2:
Use ==[[Binary Search]]==
For each element at index i:
use binary search to find index of [target-element] in the range numbers[==i+1==: ]

#finding while condition in binary search has to be less=="<="==high and not less =="<"== high

**Concepts**: #binary-search
**Link**: 
**Time**: ==O(nlogn)==, since we are doing binary search for each element
