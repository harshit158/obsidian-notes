## Approach:
#BFS
Intuition: Do a BFS from *target* as if it's a graph and find all nodes that are at level at k from target.
Problem is its a directed graph and we can't traverse upwards from target to its parent. Hence below is the algo:
1. For each node, add an additional attribute that keeps track of its parent
2. Now treating it as a graph, do a BFS from target
3. Find all nodes that lie at a depth k from target
