## Approach:
#heap 

Use ==MAX Heap==
Find distances to all points, and this is reduced to [[347. Top K Frequent Elements]]
To convert this into maxheap problem, multiply by ==-1==

```python
def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        import math
        
        def get_distance(x,y):
            distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
            return -1*distance # convert the problem into MAXHEAP
    
        heap = []
        for i, (x,y) in enumerate(points):
            dist = get_distance(x,y)
            heapq.heappush(heap, (dist, x, y))
            
            if len(heap)>k:
                heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        # At the end of for loop, we have popped (n-k) number of times, leaving us with 
        # k largest numbers (but in actual k smallest numbers)
        
        return [(x,y) for (dist, x, y) in heap]
```

#finding 
We inserted (dist, x, y) here.
If two nodes have same dist, their coordinates will be compared while inserting into the tree.

## Approach:
#heap 

Use ==MIN Heap== for storing distances of points
-> Insert all distances into heap
-> Pop k times to fetch k smallest points 

```python
def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        import math
        
        def get_distance(x,y):
            distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
            return distance
    
        heap = []
        for i, (x,y) in enumerate(points):
            dist = get_distance(x,y)
            heapq.heappush(heap, (dist, x, y))        
        
        result=[]
        for i in range(k):
            dist,x,y = heapq.heappop(heap)
            result.append((x,y))

        return result
```
