1. Accidentally revealed that I am not on the lease
   -> Consequences: Had to pay $500 
   -> Learning: Don't reveal more than what's required

2. Put Diesel into a fuel car
   -> Consequences: Had to pay $2200
   -> Learning: 
	   - Always double check for obvious possible scenarios that could go wrong
	   - Don't Push:
		   - Used funnel to pour fuel, because the nozzle didn't fit (there was a reason for that)
		   - Could have stayed and called towing service, could be less expensive
	   - Leave WELL below your means
