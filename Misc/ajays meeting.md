Wanted to share few things:
In previous meeting, I shared some observations and hypothesis regarding why things might be going wrong. 

And I realized, I did that without backing up with any numbers. I just did the eyballing on few of the results. 
Thats a bad habit. We should never do that without data. 

So the idea is to conclude everything with statistics of predictions.
And thats precisely what I did yesterday. 
But, the analysis takes time. sometimes as much as the model building itself. because its worth it. 
If we are concluding the wrong thing, then all our efforts will be gone in solving a problem which is not even a problem. 

- Deadline. I am aware of the internship end date is quite near.
- But this shouldn't change the process itself, by which it should be done. 
Basically, I dont want to go in the wrong direction just because of this pressure. Instead, we would want to land the project in 
a position, wherein anyone can pick it up and continue from there. 

- third thing is:
And this is generally done by a team of ML engineers, wherein one takes care of the model building, or the cleaning and then the analysis. And so if it takes time, it is shared by all the team members.
But here, I don't want myself worrying about this and not focus on the important thing.
